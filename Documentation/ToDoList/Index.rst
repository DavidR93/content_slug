To-Do list
==========

- Validate the anchor string directly when the editor leaves the form field (via JavaScript).
- Provide a button which allows the editor to generate an anchor with the contents of the header field.
- Allow integrators to configure the complete fragment identifier (including prefix/suffix) with TypoScript
  (instead of adapting several Fluid templates). This would also simplify several Fluid conditions.
