To-Do list
==========

- `Override fragments in RTE and TCA links <https://github.com/sebkln/content_slug/issues/5>`__:
  Backend fields like ``header_layout`` cannot only link to pages but to
  content elements as well.
  Of course, this is also possible in the rich text editor.

  If a human-readable fragment exists for these content elements,
  this should be rendered in the frontend.
